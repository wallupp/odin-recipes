<h3>After tons of trial and error, I have finally created a baked donut that isn't compromised in flavor or texture. I hope these chocolate-coffee donuts become a sweet staple to your home as they have mine! Add your favorite glaze or powdered sugar, or enjoy without anything else - they're that good!</h3>

<ul>

    <li>1 teaspoon unsalted butter</li>

    <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>

    <li>1/4 cup unsweetend cocoa powder</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

    <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>

    <li>1/4 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
    
    <li>1 egg</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>

    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    <li>1/4 cup chocolate chips</li>

</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>

<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 6-cavity donut pan with 1 teaspoon butter and set aside. </li>

<li>Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Set aside. </li>

<li>Whisk brown sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk, coffee, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; whisk until blended and smooth. Stir in chocolate chips. </li>

<li>Pour batter into a large, resealable plastic bag, cut 1 corner, and squeeze batter into the prepared donut pan, filling each mold about 2/3 full. </li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven until donuts spring back when lightly pressed, about 8 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 5 minutes; turn pan over directly onto rack to release donuts. Allow to cool for 5 minutes more</li>
</ol>
